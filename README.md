## ðŸ“š Detailed Overview

### ðŸ“Œ All User Activity by ID:

This query retrieves **all analytical events** of a specific user, showing activities like app interactions, event names, and AB-group membership.

```sql
SELECT 	created_at,
        activity_kind,
	event_name,
	JSONExtractString(base_parameters, 'ab_group') AS ab_group,
        base_parameters
FROM AdjustData.RealTimeAnalytics1
WHERE user_id = 'IDFA or GAID'
AND toDate(created_at) = today()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

## ðŸ“š Count Users by AB-Group

### ðŸ“Œ This query provides an overview of the distribution of unique users in different AB-groups:

```sql

SELECT	app_version,
	ab_group,
count (distinct user_id) AS users_unique -- user_id_example
FROM ProductData.ProjectName_product -- database_and_tableview_example
WHERE  ab_group LIKE '%01_001%' -- ab_group_number_example
GROUP BY app_version, ab_group
ORDER BY app_version, ab_group
```
## ðŸ“š User Activity by Ads

### ðŸ“Œ This includes analyzing user interactions with ads. The following SQL query retrieves the activity details of a specific user regarding ad views:

```sql

SELECT	created_at,
	JSONExtractString(base_parameters,'type') AS ad_type,
	JSONExtractString(base_parameters,'ad_placement') AS ad_placement,
	JSONExtractString(base_parameters,'status') AS ad_status,
	base_parameters -- global_events_example; used in json
FROM AdjustData.RealTimeAnalytics -- database_and_tableview_example
WHERE toDate(created_at) = today()
AND event_name = 'AdView'
AND user_id = 'IDFA or GAID' -- user_id_example
ORDER BY created_at DESC

```
