### ðŸ“Œ All User Activity by ID

This query retrieves **all analytical events** of a specific user, showing activities like app interactions, event names, and AB-group membership.

```sql
SELECT 	created_at,
        activity_kind,
	event_name,
	JSONExtractString(base_parameters, 'ab_group') AS ab_group,
        base_parameters
FROM AdjustData.RealTimeAnalytics1
WHERE user_id = 'IDFA or GAID'
AND toDate(created_at) = today()
ORDER BY created_at DESC


```sql

SELECT	app_version,
	ab_group,
count (distinct user_id) AS users_unique -- user_id_example
FROM ProductData.ProjectName_product -- database_and_tableview_example
WHERE  ab_group LIKE '%021%' -- ab_group_number_example
GROUP BY app_version, ab_group
ORDER BY app_version, ab_group
